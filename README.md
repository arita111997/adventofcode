# adventofcode2022
The changeling festive contest 


I am thrilled to announce that I have successfully completed the Advent of Code challenge! It was a challenging journey that required dedication and hard work, but it was all worth it in the end. Not only did I hone my problem-solving skills, but I also proved to myself that anyone, regardless of their background, can learn how to program. 
I am proud of myself for taking on this challenge and achieving this milestone in my personal and professional development.
As one can see, my coding skills have evolved and I've even started adding practical comments to my code. I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a programmer
